# Speech-and-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the works and laboratories of Speech and Language Processing I do in the Master's degree in Advanced Telecommunication Technologies (MATT), at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

### [Language Identification (Sentence Classification).](https://github.com/DanileRond/Speech-and-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Language_Identification.pdf)
This  report  shows  the  study  and  development  of  differentmodels  for  language  identification.We  are  comparing  theperformance of a RNN baseline system with other models forthe same task.  We will study modifications of the basic RNNmodel, as well as other DNN architectures

### [Catalan Word Vectors. Training and analysis.](https://github.com/DanileRond/Speech-and-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Catalan_WordVectors-.pdf)
This report shows the study of transforming word vectors or word embeddings. So we create, analyze, and evaluate these word vectors. They are numerical representations about contextualized words into a learned vocabulary. Specifically we are trying to get the Catalan Word Vectors by training the following model.\\
To do that task we are using a database created from Wikipedia articles.


### [Language Modeling using Transformers.](https://github.com/DanileRond/Speech-and-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Language_Modeling_with_Transformers_Navarrete_Vaccher.pdf)
This report shows the study and development of different models for non-causal language modeling. We are comparing the performance of a simple Feed Forward Neural Network with a Transformer Layer. Therefore we are increasing the number of Transformer Layers of the system and also using Multihead Attention. Finally we have applyed a normalization of Input/Output Shared Embeddings.
