## [Catalan Word Vectors. Training and analysis](https://github.com/DanileRond/Speech-and-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Catalan_WordVectors-.pdf)
This report shows the study of transforming word vectors or word embeddings. So we create, analyze, and evaluate these word vectors. They are numerical representations about contextualized words into a learned vocabulary. Specifically we are trying to get the Catalan Word Vectors by training the following model.\\
To do that task we are using a database created from Wikipedia articles.
